# elixir-phoenix-helpers

A collection of Helper's to make HTML more readable with shorter lines.

- Boostrap Icons (get_svgicons.md)
- Tailwind class combo (get_tailwind.md)

Using these helpers aims to prevent long lines of attributes in a tag. 
Like with Tailwind, it becomes very annoying to scroll the page right to see the small value. The long list of classes adds distraction, making reading harder when you try to find a dynamic label in the HTML.
